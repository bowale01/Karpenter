How Karpenter Works
Karpenter takes a different approach to autoscaling than the standard cluster autoscaler. 

standard cluster autoscaler  add or removing nodes based on demand, 

Karpenter  :- provisions nodes based on application requirements. This means that it can optimize resource utilization and reduce costs.

Karpenter works by creating custom Kubernetes resources called “provisioners.” 
Provisioners :-  are used to define the resources that Karpenter should provision, such as nodes or virtual machines. When an application needs more resources, Karpenter checks the provisioners to see if any need to be created. If so, Karpenter will create the new resources and add them to the cluster.

Comparing Karpenter to Cluster Autoscaler
Karpenter offers several advantages over the standard cluster autoscaler as detailed below.

Optimal Resource Utilization

One of the most significant advantages of Karpenter is its ability to optimize resource utilization. It can do this by automatically provisioning nodes based on application needs. This means that you can avoid overprovisioning, which can lead to wasted resources and increased costs.

Customizable Scaling

Karpenter offers the ability to customize scaling behaviors based on your specific needs. You can configure scaling based on metrics such as CPU or memory usage, or you can use your own custom metrics.

Cost Savings

Because Karpenter optimizes resource utilization, it can lead to significant cost savings. By avoiding overprovisioning, you can reduce the number of nodes required to run your applications, which can result in lower cloud bills.

Ease of Use

Karpenter is easy to use and deploy. It can be installed using Helm, and it integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes.

The standard cluster autoscaler can be more challenging to set up, and it may require more manual configuration.

How to Get Started with Karpenter
There are different ways to get started with Karpenter. This article will just highlight the steps. We will use Helm Chart to install Karpernter. Here are some steps before having it operational:

Create the KarpenterNode IAM Role — Instances launched by Karpenter must run with an InstanceProfile that grants permissions necessary to run containers and configure networking.
Create the IAM role for Karpenter Controller — Associate the Kubernetes Service Account and the IAM role using IRSA
Update aws-auth ConfigMap — to allow the nodes that use the KarpenterRole IAM Role to join the cluster
Deploy Karpenter Helm Chart:
